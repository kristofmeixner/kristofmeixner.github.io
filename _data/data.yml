# Profile
profile: |
  Kristof Meixner holds a PhD in Computer Science (2024) and a Master’s degree in Business Informatics (2018) from TU Wien, Austria, where he is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Software Engineering research unit.
  Despite experiencing an accident in 2000 resulting in a spinal cord injury, making him dependent on a wheelchair, after a break, he resumed in 2003 and successfully completed his studies.
  His PhD research explored model-based software product line engineering for cyber-physical production systems, addressing the integration of interdependent models for products, processes, and resources.
  His work focuses on advancing software engineering by developing innovative methods, tools, and techniques to create reliable, reusable systems that improve quality, resilience, and user experience.
  With a strong foundation in empirical research methods, his expertise spans software and information systems engineering.
  He is an active TU Wien member and a Scientific Staff Council representative at the Faculty of Informatics.
  As a person with a disability, he also served as a representative on the TU Wien Diversity Team for the Diversitas 2016 Award.
  Alongside his studies, Kristof gathered professional experience while working for several years as a lead developer on an open-source project specializing in software architecture, development, and quality.
  This combination of research and industry expertise drives his contributions to bridge the gap between theoretical innovation and real-world application in software engineering.
